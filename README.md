# Project 3: Phrase Hunters

## [X] Step 1:

### Download project files

- [x] app.py will contain the main logic for your project -
- [x] another “phrasehunter” folder that contains game.py and phrase.py
- [x] **init**.py which allows you to ​import from a subdirectory https://youtu.be/cONc0NcKE7s
- [x] game.py will contain the Game class to manage the functioning of the game: it has methods for showing the game, handling interactions and checking for when the game is over
- [x] phrase.py will contain the Phrase class to manage individual phrases

## [X] Step 2:

### Declare my classes

- [x] inside game.py, declare the Game class
- [x] inside phrase.py, declare the Phrase class

### Instantiate my classes.

- [x] Inside app.py, import my two classes
- [x] Add a dunder main inside my app.py
- [x] Create an instance of Phrase and assign it to a variable
- [x] Create an instance of Game and assign it to a variable.
      phrase = Phrase()
      game = Game()
- [x] test code: add temporary ​print​ statements to app.py to make sure the instances are being created.
      print(phrase)
      print(game)
